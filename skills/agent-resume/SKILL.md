description: Resume a Claude Code or Codex session later, from outside it. Use to get a status message when a long job finishes, or to wake a session after a delay ("in 3 hours, look at new PRs") even if the session has closed by then.

# Agent resume

`agent-resume` sends a message into a session when a trigger fires. The
trigger runs as a `systemd-run --user` unit, so it outlives your turn, your
process and logout, but not a reboot. `scripts/link-skills.sh` puts it on
PATH; it also lives at `bin/agent-resume` in this skill.

```bash
# Status update when a job finishes: the command runs inside the unit.
agent-resume codex --message "address any errors" -- make test

# Timed resume; the session may be closed by then.
agent-resume claude --time 3h --message "resume and look at new PRs on the repo"

agent-resume list
agent-resume cancel <trigger-id>
```

The completion message is your `--message` plus the exit status, the last 40
log lines, and the log path under `~/.local/state/agent-resume/`. The command
gets your environment and working directory. `--time` takes a systemd time
span (`90min`, `3h`, `2d`). `--dry-run` prints the systemd and delivery
commands without running anything.

## Session IDs

The session ID defaults to your own: Claude Code exports
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and Codex exports `CODEX_THREAD_ID` to the shell.
Pass another ID as the second argument to message a different session.

The message reaches a live session directly and resumes a closed one with the
permissions it last ran under. When no permissions are recorded, the resumed
session runs fully auto-approved.

## Claude prerequisite

A bypass-permissions Claude session holds messages from agent-resume for
approval unless `~/.claude/settings.json` has `"crossSessionInbound":
"accept"`. `scripts/link-skills.sh` offers to set it, and `agent-resume`
warns when a Claude trigger is scheduled without it.
